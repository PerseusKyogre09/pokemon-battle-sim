# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Pokemon stat stage modifications during battle. Pokemon can have their stats temporarily boosted or reduced through moves, with each stat having 6 stages of increase and 6 stages of decrease (ranging from -6 to +6). Each stage represents a multiplier applied to the base stat, creating strategic depth in battles through setup moves and stat manipulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want Pokemon to be able to have their stats modified during battle through moves, so that I can use strategic setup moves and stat-altering attacks to gain advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pokemon uses a stat-modifying move THEN the target Pokemon's stat stages SHALL be modified according to the move's effect
2. WHEN a stat stage is modified THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate multiplier to the affected stat
3. WHEN a stat stage would exceed +6 or go below -6 THEN the system SHALL cap the stage at the maximum/minimum value
4. WHEN a Pokemon switches out THEN all stat stage modifications SHALL be reset to 0

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see visual feedback when stats are modified, so that I can understand what changes have occurred during battle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stat is modified THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating which stat was changed and by how much
2. WHEN a stat modification fails due to stage limits THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
3. WHEN viewing a Pokemon's current state THEN the system SHALL show the current stat stage modifiers
4. WHEN a stat stage affects damage calculation THEN the modified values SHALL be used transparently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stat modifications to integrate seamlessly with existing battle mechanics, so that damage calculations and other systems work correctly with modified stats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating damage THEN the system SHALL use stat values modified by current stat stages
2. WHEN determining move accuracy THEN the system SHALL use modified accuracy and evasion stats if applicable
3. WHEN calculating speed for turn order THEN the system SHALL use modified speed values
4. WHEN a Pokemon faints THEN all stat stage modifications SHALL be cleared

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want moves like Swords Dance, Leer, and other stat-modifying moves to work correctly, so that I can use authentic Pokemon battle strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pokemon uses Swords Dance THEN its Attack stat stage SHALL increase by 2
2. WHEN a Pokemon uses Leer THEN the target's Defense stat stage SHALL decrease by 1
3. WHEN a Pokemon uses a stat-modifying move THEN the move SHALL consume a turn but deal no direct damage
4. WHEN multiple stat modifications affect the same stat THEN the effects SHALL stack additively up to the stage limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want stat modifications to persist throughout the battle until the Pokemon switches out or faints, so that setup strategies remain viable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pokemon remains in battle THEN stat stage modifications SHALL persist across multiple turns
2. WHEN a Pokemon switches out voluntarily THEN all stat stages SHALL reset to 0
3. WHEN a Pokemon is forced to switch due to fainting THEN stat stages SHALL be cleared
4. WHEN a new Pokemon enters battle THEN it SHALL start with all stat stages at 0
