# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement core stat stage multiplier calculation system





  - Create `get_stat_stage_multiplier()` method in Pokemon class that returns the correct multiplier for any stage (-6 to +6)
  - Write unit tests to verify all multiplier calculations match Pokemon standard values
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance Pokemon stat modification methods





  - Implement `modify_stat_stage()` method to safely apply stat stage changes with validation and limit checking
  - Implement `get_current_stat_stages()` method to return current stat stages for UI display
  - Update `_calculate_stat()` method to use stat stage multipliers before applying status effect modifiers
  - Write unit tests for stat stage modification and calculation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Create stat modification message generation system





  - Implement message generation logic for stat stage changes with appropriate intensity descriptions
  - Handle edge cases for stage limits with "won't go higher/lower" messages
  - Write unit tests for message generation covering all scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Enhance Move class to parse stat modifications from move data





  - Implement `_parse_stat_modifications()` method to extract "boosts" from move dataset during initialization
  - Add `stat_modifications` and `targets_self` properties to Move class
  - Implement stat name mapping from dataset abbreviations to Pokemon class stat names
  - Write unit tests for move data parsing with various boost configurations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Implement stat modification application in Move class





  - Create `_apply_stat_modifications()` method to apply stat changes to appropriate targets
  - Integrate stat modifications into `use_move()` method for both status and damaging moves
  - Handle target determination (self vs opponent) based on move data
  - Write unit tests for stat modification application
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Update Battle class to handle stat modification messages








  - Enhance `_process_attack()` method to process and display stat modification messages
  - Ensure stat modifications work for both player and opponent moves
  - Integrate stat modification messages into battle log
  - Write unit tests for battle integration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Implement stat stage reset on Pokemon switching





  - Ensure `reset_stats()` method properly resets all stat stages to 0
  - Verify stat stages are cleared when Pokemon faint or switch out
  - Write unit tests for stat stage persistence and reset behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive integration tests for stat modification system





  - Test Swords Dance move (+2 Attack) in battle scenarios
  - Test Leer move (-1 Defense) against opponent
  - Test stat stage limits and appropriate message display
  - Test interaction between stat stages and existing status effects
  - Verify stat modifications affect damage calculations correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 9. Add stat stage display to Pokemon serialization





  - Update `to_dict()` method in Pokemon class to include current stat stages
  - Ensure UI can display current stat stage information
  - Write unit tests for serialization with stat stages
  - _Requirements: 2.3_
